perfect Number
A number is a perfect number if is equal to sum of its proper divisors, that is, sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. Write a function to check if a given number is perfect or not. 


solution : 
def isperfect(n):
    factors = []
    for i in range(1,num):
        if num%i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
    total = 0
    for j in range(0,len(factors)):
        total = total+factors[j]
    if total == num :
        print('True')
    else:
        print("False")
num = int(input("Enter the num: "))
isperfect(num)
